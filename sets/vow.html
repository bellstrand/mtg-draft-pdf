		<h1>Archetypes</h1>
		<div class="archetypes">
			<div class="archetype">
				<h2>Blood/Vampires</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Bloodtithe_Harvester.jpg" />
				<span>Flexible & powerful, midrange archetype since you can punish
					stumbles with efficient creatures while building towards an
					above-average long game thanks to Blood tokens giving you extra gas
					later.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="archetype">
				<h2>Exploit/Zombies</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Skull_Skaab.jpg" />
				<span>Midrange looking to grind out value by sacrificing fodder creatures
					to zombies for bonuses. You want a solid mix of fodder, payoffs, and
					interaction to disrupt your opponent’s plans.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="archetype">
				<h2>Disturb/Spirits</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Brine_Comber.jpg" />
				<span>Emphasis on fliers, auras, and tempo. It wants to whittle its
					opponents down & create no-win situations where racing fliers means
					running through ground blockers that can then be equipped to said
					fliers.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="archetype">
				<h2>Werewolves</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Child_of_the_Pack.jpg" />
				<span>Werewolves is an aggressive-leaning midrange. Werewolves in the set
					are generally stronger and the format is less hostile towards large
					creatures.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="archetype">
				<h2>Training/Humans</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Sigardian_Paladin.jpg" />
				<span>Aggressive deck with a number of small themes: humans, +1/+1
					counters, and the training mechanic. Curving out and protecting your
					best creatures is vital for success.
				</span>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="archetypes">
			<div class="archetype">
				<h2>Life Gain</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Markov_Purifier.jpg" />
				<span>Midrange deck that can generate value while gaining an absurd
					amount of life. This dual gameplan works well against both
					aggressive and controlling opponents since it has the best hard
					removal against various bomb rares.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="archetype">
				<h2>Butts/Midrange</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Ancient_Lumberknot.jpg" />
				<span>Light and fun theme that revolves around playing creatures with
					high toughness for various payoffs.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="archetype">
				<h2>Spells</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Wandering_Mind.jpg" />
				<span>In classic Izzet fashion, it once again revolves around casting
					instants and sorceries for various payoffs. What makes Izzet unique
					is that all of the payoff-themed cards in this set say
					“non-creature” instead of “instant or sorcery.”
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="archetype">
				<h2>Aggro</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Markov_Waltzer.jpg" />
				<span>Boros is generally the fastest deck in the format. It doesn’t have
					too much synergy beyond Daybreak Combatants plus training or
					creatures plus your opponent’s face, but that doesn’t mean the deck
					isn’t viable.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="archetype">
				<h2>Self-Mill</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Vilespawn_Spider.jpg" />
				<span>Simic is themed around filling its graveyard with creatures to work
					towards various payoffs like Vilespawn Spider and Moldgraf
					Millipede. It’s generally the control deck in most matchups since it
					needs time to set up.
				</span>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h1>Mechanics</h1>
		<div class="mechanics">
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Training</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/ba77e83b-1846-4c42-bea0-2e304429fbe0.webp" />
				<span>
					Training is an aggressive mechanic that plays best with low-curve,
					high-creature-density decks aided by pump spells and equipment.
					Haste creatures like Daybreak Combatant and Markov Waltzer also play
					well with training.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Cleave</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Alchemists_Retrieval.jpg" />
				<span>Cleave acts as a mana sink or alternate cost for a diverse set of
					non-creature spells spread across all colors and primarily at higher
					rarities. It can be a bit confusing at first so just remember: each
					card with cleave is effectively 2 cards.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Blood Tokens</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Blood-Token.png" />
				<span>Blood tokens are the core mana-smoothing mechanic of the set and
					are particularly useful in longer games to pitch excess lands. They
					can also be of use in mana-light draws since digging for extra land
					early can be a lifesaver.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Disturb</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Baithook_Angler.jpg" />
				<span>Disturb is another returning mechanic from Midnight Hunt, but this
					time with a twist; creatures now return as auras instead of spirit
					creatures. This is Azorius’ () primary mechanic in draft and doesn’t
					appear in other colors.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Exploit</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Stitched_Assistant.jpg" />
				<span>Exploit is a returning mechanic that hasn’t been seen in a
					Standard-legal set since Dragons of Tarkir. It appears exclusively
					in Dimir () and only on various zombie creatures.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Day/Night bound</h2>
				<img src="/images/vow/Frenzied_Trapbreaker.jpg" />
				<span>If last turn’s player didn’t play any spells, it becomes night. If
					last turn’s player played two or more spells, it becomes day. The
					daybound side is the “untransformed” human side [day]. The
					“transformed” werewolf face is the nightbound side [night].
