				<img src="/images/dsk/Gremlin_Tamer.jpg" alt="Gremlin Tamer" />

				<h2>Eerie Control</h2>
				<img src="/images/dsk/Fear_of_Infinity.jpg" alt="Fear of Infinity" />

				<img src="/images/dsk/Wildfire_Wickerfolk.jpg" alt="Wildfire Wickerfolk" />
				<span>Fill your deck with artifact and enchantment creatures (along with other card types), and attack
					early and often. Once you get four different card types into your graveyard, your cards power up.
					Then go for the jugular!</span>

				<h2>Survival</h2>
				<img src="/images/dsk/Shrewd_Storyteller.jpg" alt="Shrewd Storyteller" />

				<h2>Reanimator</h2>

		<h1>Mechanics</h1>
		<div class="mechanics">
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Rooms</h2>
				<span>Enchantment - Room (You may cast either half. That door unlocks on the battlefield. As a sorcery,
					you may pay the mana cost of a locked door to unlock it.)</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Umbra Armor</h2>
				<span>Former: "Totem Armor". Umbra armor appears on Aura cards. If a creature enchanted by an Aura with
					umbra armor would be destroyed, instead that Aura is destroyed and all damage dealt to the creature
					is removed.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Impending</h2>
				<span>Impending [X] — (If you cast this spell for its impending cost, it enters with [X] time counters
					and isn't a creature until the last is removed. At the beginning of your end step, remove a time
					counter from it.)
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Manifest Dread</h2>
				<span>(Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2
					creature and the other into your graveyard. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a
					creature card.)</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Survival</h2>
				<span>Survival — At the beginning of your second main phase, if [CARNDAME] is tapped, you gain 2
					life.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mechanic">
				<h2>Eerie</h2>
				<span>Eerie — Whenever an enchantment you control enters and whenever you fully unlock a Room, put a
					+1/+1 counter on target creature.</span>
